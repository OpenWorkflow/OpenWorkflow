# OpenWorkflow
OpenWorkflow is an open standard for workflow definitions. 
To achieve interoperability it aims to define a programming language agnostic format for workflows and their tasks.

In concept this means that with the help of an SDK a workflow can be parsed into a standardized and serialized format, which then can be executed by schedulers and workflow management engines that support OpenWorkflow.

## Definitions
### <a name="workflow-management-engine"></a>Workflow Management Engine
A workflow management engine is a piece of software or a combination of multiple softwares which enables the definition of workflows and the execution of such on a specified runtime environment.

### <a name="workflow-bundle"></a>Workflow Bundle
A workflow bundle is a technical collection of workflows. 
It SHALL NOT imply logical grouping, although that MAY be possible, but rather the unit a scheduler is using to separate workflows and their unique attributes. 
Think of it as packages, scopes or namespaces in programming languages.

### <a name="workflow-author"></a>Workflow Author
A workflow author, typically a data engineer, business intelligence technologist or similiar, is the entity responsible for creation the workflow as well as making it available to the scheduler. 
This task can also be automated, if there exists a software which can generate the workflows for certain tasks. Such a software is also considered a workflow author. A (global) configuration which defaults or overwrites certain mutable or immutable attributes is part of the workflow authoring process and therefore considered an automated workflow author.

### <a name="workflow"></a>Workflow
A workflow is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node is a task and each edge is a dependency between those tasks. It is often just called job, DAG, package or many other names. In OpenWorkflow it is called workflow.
One execution of a workflow for a given schedule is called a `workflow instance`. 
The unique name of a workflow is called `workflow id`. 


### <a name="task"></a>Task
A task is the basic unit of execution within a workflow and a node inside the directed acyclic graph. 
It is scheduled by the scheduler and executed by the executor. 
The task contains the instructions to execute the workflow and create the desired outcome. 
The unique name of a task is called `task id`.

### <a name="dependencies"></a>Task Dependencies
Task dependencies are how tasks within a workflow relate to each other as they are the edges of the directed acyclic graph. 
One task is executed after another if it is a successor and all dependency criteria are met. 
Each task has a 0-to-N dependency to its succesors. 
A cyclic dependency MUST NOT occur. 
The dependency criteria MUST be one of (`ALL_DONE`, `ONE_DONE`, `ALL_SUCCESS`, `ONE_SUCCESS`, `ALL_FAILED`, `ONE_FAILED`).

### <a name="task-instance"></a>Task Instance
A task instance is a specific execution of a task within a workflow instance. 
If a task has a retry system the instance refers to all retries within this task's execution.

### <a name="exection-instance"></a>Execution Instance
An execution instance is a task instance which is currently being run a by an executor. 
It differs from a task instance as this is the actual run (or try) of the task.

### <a name="scheduler"></a>Scheduler
A scheduler is a piece of software that executes the workflows by deserializing them and interpreting the data structures. 
It deploys the workflow into their desired runtime environment by utilizing an executor.
It also checks for task's results and progresses the workflow based on that.

### <a name="executor"></a>Executor
An executor is a piece of software that creates or connects to runtime environments and allows for tasks to be executed on them. 
It also forwards the results to the scheduler.

### <a name="schedule-time"></a>Schedule Time
The schedule time is the time the workflow is supposed to start.

### <a name="execution-time"></a>Execution Time
The execution time is the time a workflow instance is started.

### <a name="parser"></a>Workflow Generator
A workflow generator is a piece of software or a SDK which translates one reprensentation of a workflow, created by the workflow author, into another representation which is readable by the scheduler. This can, for example, be a defined domain-specific language (DSL) which is interpretable by the scheduler or creates bytecode of sorts, or a vizual editor which directly creates the desired output format.

### <a name="broker"></a>Workflow Broker
A workflow broker is a piece of software which helps the scheduler find the correct executor for the given runtime environment of a workflow's task.

## Motivation
OpenWorkflows has two goals:
1. Define an open standard for the workings of schedulers and workflow management engines such that it becomes easier to communicate our concepts between different fields of data processing and IT.
2. Enhance comparability between engines by knowing to which version or features of OpenWorkflow they adhere.

This can be achieved as this standard will, just like the software itself, evolve over time.

## Reality Check
This is a lot of different pieces of software defined in OpenWorkflow. Do you actually need all of them? 
The short answer is no, you don't. First of all, most workflow management engines today are a all-in-one bundle, meaning most (or all) of the functionality is embedded into one application. This does not mean they don't comply with OpenWorkflow. Secondly, this should just make all the moving parts of a workflow management engine transparent. How they are implemented and coupled or decoupled is up to the software's authors. And lastly, you only need what you need. Don't try to solve problems which you _might_ have, but try to solve problems which you have. OpenWorkflow is a standard trying to encompass as many features as possible, while still remaining flexible. This does not mean everybody needs all of those features in their workflow management engine.
